🧠 AI-Assisted Coding - Reflection #3


Your Name: Susie Chan

🧩 What were you trying to do?
Describe the coding task or challenge you were working on. What problem were you trying to solve?
    Your response: I'm trying to change the calculated output into green and red font to show if it's profiting or not.

🤖 How did you use AI?
Include the prompts you gave to the AI (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot), what it responded with, and how you used or changed its suggestions.
    Your response: my prompt to ask AI is 'can you make the response in green font?'
    It responded with codes to change the font colour. I used its suggestion in my code as it is very helpful.

📘 What did you learn from the AI?
What did the AI help you understand? Did you accept its suggestions as-is, change them, or decide not to use them? Explain why.
    Your response: I still don't really understand how the codes of the colours work. I accepted its suggestion because it did help me to solve the problem, and I don't have any idea to change it.

🔁 What would you do differently next time?
Reflect on your process. How would you improve your prompt, your code, or your thinking if you faced this task again?
    Your response: Next time I will still ask AI to solve this problem, as I don't have a clear understanding of coding colours. If I've learnt to change colours like this in the future, I might try to do it myself instead of asking AI.
