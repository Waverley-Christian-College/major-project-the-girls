🧠 AI-Assisted Coding - Reflection #1

Your Name: Winnie Xu

🧩 What were you trying to do?
Describe the coding task or challenge you were working on. What problem were you trying to solve?
    Your response: 
I updated, committed and pulled the README1.md file, which had our plan on what to import, analyse and output. I then attempted at importing some of the things I needed, like requests, tingo and the sentiment analyser, but the sentiment analyser wasn't working and had errors. I'm not sure how to fix it. I did ask AI, but it still didn't work. 

🤖 How did you use AI?
Include the prompts you gave to the AI (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot), what it responded with, and how you used or changed its suggestions.
    Your response:
I asked it to help me plan what the output should be, so like printing out the line graph using matplotlib. I also asked it to help me write a code and explain what it did by giving it my plan, and it came out with the imports and all that but when I put it into my code it didn't work. 

📘 What did you learn from the AI?
What did the AI help you understand? Did you accept its suggestions as-is, change them, or decide not to use them? Explain why.
    Your response:
It helped me understand how my code should run, like the steps and what to do. I did change one of its decisions when it suggested I could make a graph on how positive the companies' new headlines are, but I changed it to how well their stocks are going. 

🔁 What would you do differently next time?
Reflect on your process. How would you improve your prompt, your code, or your thinking if you faced this task again?
    Your response:
I would research more on the sentiment analyser thing that I will use because I wasn't very sure on how to import in into the code.
