🧠 AI-Assisted Coding - Reflection #1


Your Name: Susie Chan

🧩 What were you trying to do?
Describe the coding task or challenge you were working on. What problem were you trying to solve?
	Your response: I'm trying to create a table layout showing the difference of share prices/share holdings between dates. I don't know how to create a table by coding so I asked AI to understand the concept.

🤖 How did you use AI?
Include the prompts you gave to the AI (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot), what it responded with, and how you used or changed its suggestions.
	Your response: I asked AI to 'create a table layout' referencing the tiingo.py file and show what the output might look like. It responded a sample code and table layout according to the input company. I'm just wanting to gain some information about this so I didn't use it in the codespace yet.

📘 What did you learn from the AI?
What did the AI help you understand? Did you accept its suggestions as-is, change them, or decide not to use them? Explain why.
	Your response: it helped me to understand what to do to create a table. While I had just asked a brief question, the response for the table layout was not the actual thing I wanted to have, so I didn't use it.

🔁 What would you do differently next time?
Reflect on your process. How would you improve your prompt, your code, or your thinking if you faced this task again?
	Your response: I might type the prompt in a more specific way to get a direct response that I want. Giving it my thoughts on how the table should look like.
